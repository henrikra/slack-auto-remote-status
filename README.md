2. Fill it with this info

```
SLACK_TOKEN=YOUR_SLACK_TOKEN
OFFICE_NETWORK=YOUR_OFFICE_NETWORK_NAME

3. Open `com.slack.watcher.plist` and change value of `ProgramArguments` to a path pointing to `slack-auto-remote-status.sh`
4. Make sure network watcher is started when you log in with `cp com.slack.watcher.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents`
